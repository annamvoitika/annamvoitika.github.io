          It brings me great joy to work on software projects every single day.
          I've grown as a developer, working alongside exceptional professionals
          and practicing software and data engineering during work as well as
          personal projects. I aim for continuous professional and personal
          growth. There really is no limit to what you can create as a software
          engineer.
